# Naming conventions for classes, methods and variables

## Motivation

The purpose of this ADR is to standardize the naming convention throughout the project to avoid inconsistencies.

## Decision

- Prefix abstract classes with `Abstract`
- Suffix interfaces with `Interface`
- Suffix traits with `Trait`
- Suffix exceptions with `Exception`
- Use `PascalCase` for class names
- Use `camelCase` for PHP variables, function and method names, arguments

## Consequences

Establishing a single naming scheme improves readability and maintainability across the code base.
